The term "pushdown" refers to the fact that the stack can be regarded as being "pushed down" like a tray dispenser at a cafeteria, since the operations never work on elements other than the top element. 

A [[Stack Automata]], by contrast, does allows access to and operations on deeper elements. 

Stack automata can recognize a strictly larger sets of languages than pushdown automata.

A [[Stack Automata#Nested Stack Automata]] allows full access, and alose allows stacked values to be entire sub-stacked rather than just single finite symbols.
