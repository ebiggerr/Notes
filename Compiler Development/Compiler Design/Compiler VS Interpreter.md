# What is an interpreter?
An interpreter is another commond kind of language processor. Instead of producing a *target program* as a translation, an interpreter appears directly execute the operations specified in the source program on inputs supplied by the user.

The machine-language target program produced by a compiler is usually much faster than a interpreter at mapping inputs to outputs. An interpreter, however, can usually give better error diagnostic than a compiler, because it executes the source program statement by statement.
