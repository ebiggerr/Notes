# Digital Image

A digital image may be defied as as two-dimensional function $f(x,y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are spatial(plane) coordinated, and the amplitide of $f$ at any pair of coordinates $(x,y)$ is called the ==intensity== or ==gray level== of the image at that point. When $x$, $y$ and the intensity values of $f$ are all finite, discrete quantities, we call the image a `digital image`.

# Pixels
A digital image is composed of a finite number of elements, each of which has a particular location and value. ==Pixel== is the term used most widely to denote the elements of a digital image.

# Representing Digital Image

Let $f(s,t)$ represent a continuos image function of two continuos variables, s and t. We convert this function into a digital image by [[Image Acquistion#Sampling]] and [[Image Acquistion#Quantization]] 

Suppose that we sample the continuous image into a digital image, $f(x,y)$, containing M rows and N column, where $(x,y)$ are discrete coordinates.
