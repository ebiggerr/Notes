# Inference Engine

The inference engine is the part that contains the mechanism of function of thinking and reasoning pattern system used by a expert.

The mechanism will analyse a particular problm and will then seek the best answer or conclusion. The inferece engine start tracking by matching rules in the knowledge base to the facts in the database.

There are two exisitng inference techniques
- [[#Backward Chaining]]  - started reasoning from hypothesis towards fact conclusions containing this hypothesis.
- [[#Forward Chaining]]- started from a set of data towards the conclusion.

## Backward Chaining
Backward chaining 

## Forward Chaining
Forward chaining is a search method or forward tracking technique that start with exsiting information and combine rules  to produce a conclusion or to reach a goal/purpose.
Forward chaining is an inference method that does reasoning from a problem to the solution. It is ==data-driven== because inference begins with available information and new conclusions are obtained.
