## Supervised algorithms VS Unsupervised algorithms

The distinction between supervised and unsupervised algorithms is not formally and rigidly deffined because there is not objective test for distinguish whether a value is a feature of a target provided by a supervisor. Informally, unsupervised learning refers to mostt attempts to extract information from a distribution that do not require human labour to annotate examples.
