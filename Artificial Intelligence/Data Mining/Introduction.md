# Data Mining

==Concepts of Data Mining==

Take a look at the classic example used when explaining [[Association Rules]], the [[Market Basket Analysis]].

Transactions (market basket) that are obtained from a supermarket.

| Transaction | Item  | Item 2 | Item 3
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Transaction 1| milk | bread | sugar |
|Transaction 2| milk |  bread |  biscuit |
|Transaction 3| milk | bread | chocolate |

An experienced decision maker of the supermarket may have summarized the patterns such as "when a customer buys milk, he/she also buys bread"

This can be used to predict customer behaviour or used to estimate the sales of new product. 

==Data mining== is a process of discovering valuable information from large amount of data stored in database, data warehouses, or other information repositories. Data mining attempts to extract potentially useful knowledge from data.
