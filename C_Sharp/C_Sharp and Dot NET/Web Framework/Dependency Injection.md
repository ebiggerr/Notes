DI is a software design pattern in which one or more dependencies (or services) are injected, or passed by reference, into a dependent object (or client) and are made part of the client's state. 

The pattern separates the creation of a client's dependencies from its own behavior, which allows program design to be loosely coupled and to follow the dependency inversion and single responsibility principles. 

==In contrast== with the `service locator pattern`
