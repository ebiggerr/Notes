In ABP, each application service method is assumed to be a `unit of work` by default. It automatically creates a connection and begins a transaction at the beginning of the method. If the method successfully completes without exception, then the transaction is committed and the connection is disposed. 

Even if this method used different repositories or methods, all of them will be atomic(transactional). All changes on entities are automatically saved when a transaction is commited.
