# The Language 

C# and Java are members of the C family of programming languages ( For example, C, Objective C, C++). Therefore, share a similar syntax.

Many of C#''s sytatic construcst are modeled after various aspects of VB and C++. 

For example,  ( applies up to .NET 3.5 )
- support the notion of class properties ( as opposed to traditional setter and getter methods) and optional parameters. 
- allows its user to overload operators, as well as create structures, enumerations, and callback functions (via delegates).
- supports lambda expressions and autonomous types, and with the advet of LINQ (Language Integrated Query), it supports a number of constructs that make it quite unique language.
- spport for attribute-based programming. Allows to annotate types and their members to further qualify their behavoir.
- te ability to build generic types and generic members.
- support for annonymous methods, that allows its user to supply an inline funciton anywhere a delegate type is required.
- ability to define a single type across multiple code files.
- support for strongly typed queries ( For example, LINQ ) used to interact with various forms of data.
- ability to extend the functionality of an existing type (without subclassing) using extension methods.
- inclusion of a lambda operator ( =>)
- new object initialization syntax, which allows programmers to set property values at time of object creation.
