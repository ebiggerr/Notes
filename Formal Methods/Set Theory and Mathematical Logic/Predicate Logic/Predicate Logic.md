The language of propostions introduced (See [[Propositional Logic]] ) allows us to make statements about specific object, but it does not allow us to make statement such as "Every cloud has a silver lining". These are known as `universal` statements, since they describe properties that must be satisfied by `every` object in some universe of discourse.

### Universal Statement
-	 Each student must hand in course work.

### Existential statement
- I heard it from one of your friends.

To formalise such statements, we require a language that reveals the internal structure of our propositional statement, a language that allows us to take them apart and apply them to objects without proper names. The language we require is the language of predicate calculus.
