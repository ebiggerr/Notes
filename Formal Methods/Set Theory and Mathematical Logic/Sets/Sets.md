# Sets
Mathematical objects are often seen as a collections of other objects.

These collections are called `sets`, and their theory is a fundamental part of mathematics.

### Membership and extension

A set is any well-defined collection of objects. If a set is suffciently small, we may define it by `extension`. To do this, we produce a list of its elements; a set `s` containing three elements `a`,`b` and `c` could be defied by 

$$ s== \{a,b,c \} $$

The notation `n == e` means that `n` is by definition a name for, and hence equal to, the expression `e`. We say that `n` is a syntatic abbreviation for `e`.

The idea of set membership allows us to characterize equality between sets. Two sets `s` and `t` are equal if and only if they have the same elements, that is every member of `s` is also a member of `t` and every member of `t` is also a member of `s`.

### Set comprehension

Given any non-empty set `s`, we can define a new set by considering only those elements of `s` that satisfy some property `p`. This method of definition is called ==comprehension==

We write
$$ \{ x: s | p \} $$ 
to denote the set of elements `x` inn `s` that satisfy predicate `p`.
