# Z language ( Z notation )

- Based on typed set theory
- Includes schemas, an effective low-level structuring facility
- Schemas are specification building blocks
- Graphical presentation of schema makes Z specification easier to understand.

Mathematical objects and their properties can be collected together in `schemas`: patterns of declaration and constraints. The schema language can be used to describe the state of a system, and the ways in which that state may change. It can also be used to describe system properties, and to reason about possible refinements of a design.

A characteristics feature of Z is the use of `types`. Each object in the mathematical language has a unique type, represented by a maximum set in the current specification. 

The Z notation, is a [mathematical language](Index%20(Mathematicals).md) with a poweful structuring mechanism. In combination with natural language, it can be used to produce formal specifications. 

Z is not intended for the description of non-functional properties, such as usability, performance, size and reliability. Neither it is intended for the description of timed or concurrent behaviour.
